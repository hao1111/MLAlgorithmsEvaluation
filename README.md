# MLAlgorithmsEvaluation
Evaluation of SVM , MLP, Least Square Support Vector Machine(LSSVM) and AdaBoost

Pattern Recognition Course Final Project

In this project we chose four important Machine Learning algorithms in classification task and studied their advantages and disadvantages. Then we implemented these algorithms in
MATLAB software and applied them to some popular datasets available in UCI website
